# MiniBank
A little bank I made with many features like deposite, withdraw and more coming with further releases.

## Features
- Classes
- Account creation
- Pin protection
- Deposit (pin protected)
- Withdrawl (pin protected)
- Shows balance
- Roasts you for having less than $100
Withdrawl is limited to available balance and deposit can't be in negative.

## How to run
1. Compile program.
2. Run 'main.java'.
3. Have a bank account in a useless bank

## Why built it
I built it to test my programming skills and the new stuff I learned.
