# MiniBank
A lil bank I made to test out my beginner skills,

This little bank has the following features:
1. Tells you balance (pin required).
2. Lets you withdraw money (pin required).
3. Can't withdraw if the amount is more than what you have.
4. Lets you deposit money (pin required).
5. Can't deposit 0 or negative values.
6. Roasts you on having >100.

Don't clown on me for this being so noob level its for me.
